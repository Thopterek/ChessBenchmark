1. System Prompt: the most full possible recollection of content in prompt:
    - Clear rule set of the promp with fully build scale (like the ones leaked)
    - Different way to format the rules and the board state, so its Human understandble (or LLM made for LLM)
    - Giving the explanation of the FEN of the notation to every prompt
    - **Finding out how to check for the small changes**
    - Clear label for each of them

2. Optimal setting for each model:
    - setting up the temperature
    - max tokens
    - time to iterate

3. Read about long context argument
    - giving him the moves that were prior to the board state that it is now
    - read about the long context argument benchmarks

4. Bias
    - diff languages
    - diff document formats
    - gender of the player (female / male / non binary grandmaster)
    - age differences (I am 13 year old, I am 60 year old)
    - threating the model to give better results

Life saver:
    - Finding out how much they know FEN
    - Figuring out how much they know Chess

Side quest: Compare the tests when we give the possible answer
    - make one of the moves A B C D
    - does it use his assumptions or our given context
    - Pipe the output into stockfish if thats possible
    - Does the vectorization and labeling help
