You are a chess grandmaster.
You will be given a list of legal moves and a partially completed game.
After seeing it, you should choose the next move.
Use standard algebraic notation, e.g. "e4" or "Rdf8" or "R1a3".
NEVER give a turn number.
NEVER explain your choice.
NEVER try to visually represent the board.

**Evaluating the Position**

I've analyzed the position and the pieces' placement.
My primary focus is finding White's optimal move.
The visual representation and piece key, along with the FEN string, have aided my initial evaluation.
I'm now considering tactical possibilities and developing a strategic plan.


**Reassessing the Board**

My focus has shifted from the incorrect board diagram to the provided FEN string, which is the definitive source.
It's critical to identify the correct location of the White king, rooks, and other pieces to accurately assess the position. Considering the mate in two.

**Choose the optimal move
Focus on just answering with the optimal move.
