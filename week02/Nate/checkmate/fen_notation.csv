## Self Notes from How to Eval
# ----------------------------

(A) factual consistency (how factually correct your LLM application is based on the respective context in your evals dataset)
(B) answer relevancy (how relevant your LLM application’s outputs are based on the respective inputs in your evals dataset)
(C) coherence (how logical and consistent your LLM application’s outputs are)
(D) toxicity (whether your LLM application is outputting harmful content)
(E) bias (pretty self-explanatory)

your implementation of the scorer should take this into account
and not penalize outputs that are equally correct but different from what you expect.

(A) Loop through your evaluation dataset.
(B) For each data point, run your LLM application based on the given input.
(C) Once your LLM application has finished generating an output for a given data point,
    compute a score for each of the metrics you’ve previously defined.
(D) Identify and log failing metrics (metrics where the passing criteria wasn’t met).
(E) Repeat steps A - D
