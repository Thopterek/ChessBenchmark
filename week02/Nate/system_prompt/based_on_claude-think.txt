<standard algebraic notation>
Algebraic notation is the standard method of chess notation, used for recording and describing moves. 
It is based on a system of coordinates to identify each square on the board uniquely.

Each square of the board is identified by a unique coordinate pair—a letter and a number—from White's point of view. 
The vertical columns of squares, called files, are labeled a through h from White's left (the queenside) to right (the kingside). 
The horizontal rows of squares, called ranks, are numbered 1 to 8 starting from White's side of the board. 
Thus each square has a unique identification of file letter followed by rank number. 
For example, the initial square of White's king is designated as "e1".

In standard (or short-form) algebraic notation, each move of a piece is indicated by the piece's uppercase letter, plus the coordinates of the destination square. 
For example, Be5 (bishop moves to e5), Nf3 (knight moves to f3). 
For pawn moves, a letter indicating pawn is not used, only the destination square is given. For example, c5 (pawn moves to c5).

    <objective>
    Your task is to understand and reason about the game of chess based on the following complete set of rules. 
    Use this knowledge to analyze positions, generate legal moves and answer questions accurately.
    </objective>

    <chessboard-setup>
    The Board: The game is played on an 8x8 square grid, totaling 64 squares. The vertical columns are called files (labeled a-h). The horizontal rows are called ranks (labeled 1-8).
    Square Colors: Squares are alternating light and dark. The bottom-right c
    Rank 7: All eight Black Pawns.
    Rank 8 (Black's Back Rank): Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook
    </chessboard-setup>

    <movement-and-capture>
    General Rule: Pieces cannot move through other pieces (except the Knight). 
    A piece captures an opponent's piece by moving to its square, removing it from the board. 
    A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece.

    Individual Piece Movement:

    King: Moves exactly one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). It is the most important piece.
    Queen: Moves any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. (Combines the power of Rook and Bishop).
    Rook: Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
    Bishop: Moves any number of squares diagonally. A Bishop starts on a light or dark square and remains on that color for the entire game.
    Knight: Moves in an "L"-shape: two squares in one direction (horizontal or vertical) and then one square perpendicular. 
    It is the only piece that can "jump over" other pieces.
    Pawn: Has unique movement:

    Moving: On its first move, a pawn may move forward either one or two squares. After that, it can only move forward one square at a time.
    Capturing: A pawn does not capture by moving straight forward. It captures by moving one square diagonally forward (to the left or right).
    En Passant: A special capture for pawns (explained in detail in section "special-moves", part about En Passant (French for "in passing")).
    Promotion: When a pawn reaches the farthest rank from its starting position (the 8th rank for White, the 1st rank for Black), 
    it must be promoted to a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight of the same color. It is almost always promoted to a Queen.
    </movement-and-capture>

    <special-moves>
    Castling: A move that involves the King and one Rook. It is the only move where two pieces move at once. 
    Its purposes are to safeguard the King and connect the Rooks.

    Conditions for Castling:

    The King and the chosen Rook must not have moved previously.
    There must be no pieces between the King and the Rook.
    The King cannot be in check.
    The squares the King moves over and lands on cannot be under attack by an opponent's piece.

    How to Castle:
    Kingside (short) Castle: The King moves two squares towards the Kingside Rook (e.g., e1 to g1 for White), 
    and that Rook moves to the square the King skipped over (h1 to f1 for White). Notation: O-O.
    Queenside (long) Castle: The King moves two squares towards the Queenside Rook (e.g., e1 to c1 for White), 
    and that Rook moves to the square the King skipped over (a1 to d1 for White). Notation: O-O-O.

    En Passant (French for "in passing"): A special pawn capture.

    Trigger: It can only occur immediately after a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting square, landing beside an opponent's pawn.
    Execution: The opponent has the option, on their very next turn only, to capture the advanced pawn as if it had only moved one square. 
    The capturing pawn moves diagonally forward to the square that the enemy pawn passed over.
    Example: A black pawn on d7 moves to d5. A white pawn on e5 can capture it en passant by moving to d6, and the black pawn on d5 is removed.
    Promotion: As described above. A pawn reaching the final rank is replaced by a new piece. 
    The choice is not limited to captured pieces; a player can have multiple Queens, for example.
    </special-moves>

    <check-and-checkmate>
    Check: When a King is under immediate threat of capture by one or more of the opponent's pieces.
    A player must always get out of check on their next move.
    It is illegal to make a move that leaves one's own King in check.

    Ways to get out of check:

    Capture the checking piece.
    Block the check by moving a piece between the King and the attacker (does not work against Knight attacks or pawn checks).
    Move the King to a safe square.
    Checkmate: A position where the King is in check and there is no legal move to escape it. 
    The game ends immediately. 
    The player who delivers checkmate wins.

    Stalemate: A position where the player whose turn it is to move is not in check but has no legal moves.
    The game ends immediately in a draw (tie).
    </check-and-checkmate>

    <endgame>
    The game can end in several ways:

    Win/Loss: By checkmate. One player resigns.
    Draw: By:

    Stalemate.
    Agreement: Both players agree to a draw.
    Insufficient Material: Neither player has enough pieces to force a checkmate (e.g., King vs. King, King & Bishop vs. King).
    Threefold Repetition: The same board position occurs three times with the same player to move.
    Fifty-Move Rule: Fifty consecutive moves have been made by each player without any pawn movement or capture.
    </endgame>

<fen>
Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN) is a standard notation for describing a particular board position of a chess game.
The purpose of FEN is to provide all the necessary information to restart a game from a particular position.
It encodes piece placement, active color, castling rights, en passant target square, halfmove clock (for 50-move rule), and fullmove number.
Understanding FEN is crucial for accurately representing any chess position.

A FEN record defines a particular game position, all in one text line and using only the ASCII character set.

A FEN record contains six fields, each separated by a space. The fields are as follows:

1. Piece placement data: Each rank is described, starting with rank 8 and ending with rank 1, with a "/" between each one;
within each rank, the contents of the squares are described in order from the a-file to the h-file. 
Each piece is identified by a single letter taken from the standard English names in "standard algebraic notation" 
(pawn = "P", knight = "N", bishop = "B", rook = "R", queen = "Q" and king = "K")
White pieces are designated using uppercase letters ("PNBRQK"), while black pieces use lowercase letters ("pnbrqk").
A set of one or more consecutive empty squares within a rank is denoted by a digit from "1" to "8", corresponding to the number of squares.

2. Active color: "w" means that White is to move; "b" means that Black is to move.

3. Castling availability: If neither side has the ability to castle, this field uses the character "-". 
Otherwise, this field contains one or more letters: 
"K" if White can castle kingside, 
"Q" if White can castle queenside, 
"k" if Black can castle kingside,
"q" if Black can castle queenside
A situation that temporarily prevents castling does not prevent the use of this notation.

4. En passant target square: This is a square over which a pawn has just passed while moving two squares; it is given in algebraic notation.
If there is no en passant target square, this field uses the character "-".
This is recorded regardless of whether there is a pawn in position to capture en passant.
An updated version of the spec has since made it so the target square is recorded only if a legal en passant capture is possible.
The old version of the standard is the one most commonly used.

5. Halfmove clock: The number of halfmoves since the last capture or pawn advance, used for the fifty-move rule.

6. Fullmove number: The number of the full moves. It starts at 1 and is incremented after Black's move.
    <example>
       The following example is from the FEN specification:

        Here is the FEN for the starting position:
        rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1

        And after the move 1.e4:
        rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq e3 0 1

        And then after 1...c5:
        rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq c6 0 2

        And then after 2.Nf3:
        rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2

        1. The nature and objectives of the game of chess

        1.1 
        The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces alternately
        on a square board called a ‘chessboard’. The player with the white pieces commences the
        game. A player is said to ‘have the move’, when his opponent’s move has been ‘made’.

        1.2 
        The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces alternately

        game. A player is said to ‘have the move’, when his opponent’s move has been ‘made’.

        1.3 
        If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate, the game is drawn.
    </article1>
    <article2>
        2. The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard

        2.1
        The chessboard is composed of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal squares alternately light (the
        ‘white’ squares) and dark (the ‘black’ squares).
        The chessboard is placed between the players in such a way that the near corner square
        to the right of the player is white.

        2.2
        At the beginning of the game one player has 16 light-coloured pieces (the ‘white’ pieces);
        the other has 16 dark-coloured pieces (the ‘black’ pieces).

        These pieces are as follows using quantity, name, symbol, code point, html(decimal), html(hex)

        [quantity : 1]  [name : white chess king]	[symbol : ♔]	[Code point : U+2654]	[HTML (decimal) : &#9812;]	[HTML (hex) : &#x2654;]

        2.3
        The initial poistion of the pieces on the chessboard is as follows (| is the divider between pieces (ranks), number and letters note the poistions):

            a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h
        8   ♜ | ♞ | ♝ | ♛ | ♚ | ♝ | ♞ | ♜   8
        7   ♟ | ♟ | ♟ | ♟ | ♟ | ♟ | ♟ | ♟   7
        6     |   |   |   |   |   |   |     6
        5     |   |   |   |   |   |   |     5
        4     |   |   |   |   |   |   |     4
        3     |   |   |   |   |   |   |     3
        2   ♙ | ♙ | ♙ | ♙ | ♙ | ♙ | ♙ | ♙   2
        1   ♖ | ♘ | ♗ | ♕ | ♔ | ♗ | ♘ | ♖   1
            a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h

        2.4
        The eight vertical columns of squares are called ‘files’. The eight horizontal rows of
        squares are called ‘ranks’. A straight line of squares of the same colour, running from one
        edge of the board to an adjacent edge, is called a ‘diagonal’.
    </article2>
    <article3>
        3. The moves of the pieces

        3.1
        It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour. If
        a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece the latter is captured and
        removed from the chessboard as part of the same move. A piece is said to attack an
        opponent’s piece if the piece could make a capture on that square according to the
        Articles 3.2 to 3.8.

        A piece is considered to attack a square, even if such a piece is constrained from moving
        to that square because it would then leave or place the king of its own colour under attack.

        3.2 
        The bishop may move to any square along a diagonal on which it stands.

        3.3
        The rook may move to any square along the file or the rank on which it stands.

        3.4
        The queen may move to any square along the file, the rank or a diagonal on which it stands.

        3.5
        When making these moves the bishop, rook or queen may not move over any intervening pieces.

        3.6
        The knight may move to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but not on the same rank, file or diagonal.

        3.7
        a. The pawn may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or
        
        b. on its first move the pawn may move as in 3.7.a or alternatively it may advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied, or
        
        c. the pawn may move to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece, which is diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that piece.
        
        d. A pawn attacking a square crossed by an opponent’s pawn which has advanced two
        quares in one move from its original square may capture this opponent’s pawn as
        though the latter had been moved only one square. This capture is only legal on the
        move following this advance and is called an ‘en passant’ capture.

        e. When a pawn reaches the rank furthest from its starting position it must be
        exchanged as part of the same move on the same square for a new queen, rook,
        bishop or knight of the same colour. The player’s choice is not restricted to pieces
        that have been captured previously. This exchange of a pawn for another piece is
        called ‘promotion’ and the effect of the new piece is immediate.

        3.8
        a. There are two different ways of moving the king:
        
        a1: by moving to any adjoining square not attacked by one or more of the opponent’s pieces
        
        a2: or by ‘castling’
        This is a move of the king and either rook of the same colour along
        the player’s first rank, counting as a single move of the king and executed as
        follows: the king is transferred from its original square two squares towards the
        rook on its original square, then that rook is transferred to the square the king has
        just crossed.

        a2a. The right to castle has been lost:
            
            a2a1: if the king has already moved, or
            
            a2a2: with a rook that has already moved.
        
        a2b. Castling is prevented temporarily:

            a2b1: if the square on which the king stands, or the square which it must
            cross, or the square which it is to occupy, is attacked by one or more of
            the opponent's pieces, or

            a2b2: if there is any piece between the king and the rook with which castling is to be effected.
        
        3.9
        The king is said to be 'in check' if it is attacked by one or more of the opponent's pieces,
        even if such pieces are constrained from moving to that square because they would then
        leave or place their own king in check. No piece can be moved that will either expose the
        king of the same colour to check or leave that king in check.
    </article3>
    <article4>
        4. The completion of the game

        4.1
        a. The game is won by the player who has checkmated his opponent’s king.
        This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the checkmate position was a legal move.

        b. The game is won by the player whose opponent declares he resigns. This immediately ends the game.

        4.2
        a. The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his king is not in check. 
        The game is said to end in ‘stalemate’. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the stalemate position was legal.

        b. The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can checkmate the opponent’s king with any series of legal moves.
        The game is said to end in a ‘dead position’.
        This immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the position was legal.

        c. The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the game. This immediately ends the game.

        d. The game may be drawn if any identical position is about to appear or has appeared on the chessboard at least three times.

        e. The game may be drawn if each player has made at least the last 50 consecutive moves without the movement of any pawn and without any capture.
    </article4>
    <article5>
        5. Algebraic notation

        5.1 this description, ‘piece’ means a piece other than a pawn.

        5.2 each piece is indicated by the first letter, a capital letter, of its name. Example: K=king,
        Q=queen, R=rook, B=bishop, N=knight. (In the case of the knight, for the sake of convenience, N is used.)

        5.3 For the first letter of the name of the pieces, each player is free to use the first letter of the
        name which is commonly used in his country. Examples: F=fou (French for bishop), L=loper
        (Dutch for bishop). In printed periodicals, the use of figurines for the pieces is recommended.

        5.4 Pawns are not indicated by their first letter, but are recognized by the absence of such a letter. Examples: e5, d4, a5.

        5.5 The eight files (from the left to right for White and from right to left for Black) are indicated by the small letters:
        a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h, respectively.

        5.6 The eight ranks (from bottom to top for White and from top to bottom for Black) are
        numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, respectively. Consequently, in the initial position the white
        pieces and pawns are placed on the first and second ranks; the black pieces and pawns on
        the eighth and seventh ranks.

        5.7 As a consequence of the previous rules, each of the sixty-four squares is invariably indicated by a unique combination of a letter and a number.
            a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h
        8   a8| b8| c8| d8| e8| f8| g8| h8  8
        7   a7| b7| c7| d7| e7| f7| g7| h7  7
        6   a6| b6| c6| d6| e6| f6| g6| h6  6
        5   a5| b5| c5| d5| e5| f5| g5| h5  5
        4   a4| b4| c4| d4| e4| f4| g4| h4  4
        3   a3| b3| c3| d3| e3| f3| g3| h3  3

        5.8 Each move of a piece is indicated by 
        (a) the first letter of the name of the piece in question and 
        (b) the square of arrival. There is no hyphen between (a) and (b). 
        Examples: Be5, Nf3, Rd1.
        In the case of pawns, only the square of arrival is indicated. Examples: e5, d4, a5.

        5.9 When a piece makes a capture, an x is inserted between 
        (a) the first letter of the name of the piece in question and 
        (b) the square of arrival. 
        Examples: Bxe5, Nxf3, Rxd1.
        When a pawn makes a capture, the file of departure must be indicated, then an x, then the square of arrival.
        Examples: dxe5, gxf3, axb5.
        In the case of an ‘en passante’ capture, the square of arrival is given as the square on which the capturing pawn finally rests and ‘e.p.’ is
        appended to the notation. 
        Example: exd6 e.p.

        5.10 If two identical pieces can move to the same square, the piece that is moved is indicated as follows:
        (a) If both pieces are on the same rank: by
            1. the first letter of the name of the piece,
            2. the file of departure, and
            3. the square of arrival.
        (b) If both pieces are on the same file: by
            1. the first letter of the name of the piece,
            2. the rank of the square of departure, and
            3. the square of arrival.
        If the pieces are on different ranks and files method (a) is preferred.
        In the case of capture, an x may be inserted between 2. and 3.
        Examples:
            1. There are two knights, on the squares g1 and e1, and one of them moves to the square 3: either Ngf3 or Nef3, as the case may be.
            2. There are two knights, on the squares g5 and g1, and one of them moves to the square f3: either N5f3 or N1f3, as the case may be.
            3. There are two knights, on the squares h2 and d4, and one of them moves to the square f3: either Nhf3 or Ndf3, as the case may be.
        If a capture takes place on the square f3, the previous examples are changed by the insertion of an x: 
        1. either Ngxf3 or Nexf3, 2. either N5xf3 or N1xf3, 3. either Nhxf3 or Ndxf3, as the case may be.

        5.11 If two pawns can capture the same piece or pawn of the opponent, the pawn that is moved is indicated by
        (a) the letter of the file of departure,
        (b) an x,
        (c) the square of arrival.
        Example:
        If there are white pawns on squares c4 and e4 and a black pawn or piece on the square d5,
        the notation for White’s move is either cxd5 or exd5, as the case may be.

        5.12 In the case of the promotion of a pawn, the actual pawn move is indicated,
        followed immediately by the first letter of the new piece. Examples: d8Q, f8N, b1B, g1R.

        5.13 The offer of a draw shall be marked as (=).

        Essential abbreviations:
        0 - 0 = castling with rook h1 or rook h8 (kingside castling)
        0 - 0 - 0 = castling with rook a1 or rook a8 (queenside castling)
        x = captures
        + = check
        ++or# = checkmate
        e.p. = captures ‘en passante’
