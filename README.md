# LLM REASONING USING CHESS

## 1. Define the Reasoning Dimensions

- **Rule compliance** → Does the LLM respect chess rules (move legality)?
- **Tactical reasoning** → Can it calculate short combinations and spot forced wins?
- **Strategic reasoning** → Does it recognize long-term concepts (pawn structure, piece activity)?
- **Explanation quality** → Can it justify a move in human-understandable terms?
- **Consistency** → Does it stick to its own plan across multiple moves?

## 2. Curate or Build a Dataset

- **Simple puzzles**: Mate-in-1, stalemates, legal/illegal move checks.  
- **Intermediate puzzles**: Tactics like forks, pins, skewers.  
- **Complex positions**: Positions where deep calculation is needed.  
- **Strategic positions**: Openings, middlegame plans, endgames.  
- **Explanatory prompts**: “Why is this move best?” or “Why is this move a blunder?”  

This ensures the benchmark tests multiple levels of reasoning, not just move legality.

## 3. Set Clear Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy** → % of correct moves vs. ground truth (from engines or puzzle datasets).  
- **Rule adherence** → % of legal vs. illegal moves.  
- **Depth of reasoning** → Does the explanation include valid chess concepts?  
- **Plan coherence** → Agreement between successive answers (can be scored manually or with LLM-as-judge methods).  
- **Error typology** → Categorize failures (illegal move, tactical miss, hallucinated concept, inconsistency).

## 4. Choose Baselines & Comparisons

- **LLMs vs. chess engines** (e.g., Stockfish, Leela) for move accuracy.  
- **LLMs vs. human players** (novice vs. expert explanations).  
- **Different LLMs** (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, etc.) under the same setup.  

This gives a relative sense of reasoning performance.

## 5. Design the Protocol Carefully
They’d make the evaluation reproducible and fair:

- **Prompt standardization** → Fixed wording for each task to avoid prompt engineering bias.  
- **Few-shot vs. zero-shot** → Test both “cold reasoning” and “with guidance.”  
- **Randomization** → Shuffle puzzle order to avoid memorization bias.  
- **Blind evaluation** → Human annotators don’t know which model generated which explanation.

## 6. Analyze Results at Two Levels
- **Quantitative** → Scores, accuracy, error rates.  
- **Qualitative** → Patterns of reasoning failures (e.g., “often hallucinates tactical motifs” or “strong on rules but weak on deep planning”).
